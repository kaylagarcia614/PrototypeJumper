## First-Time Installation Steps

To get the npm package setup and working, start a VSCode terminal and run `npm install` followed by `npm run watch_games`. You should now no longer be able to type into the console (hint: if you'd like to exit, press `CTRL + C`). Meanwhile, open your browser and access the URL `http://localhost:4000/?jumper`.
